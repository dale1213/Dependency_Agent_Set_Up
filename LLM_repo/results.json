As such, most of the code is already written - you only need to add a couple lines of code at the right place.\n\nIf you don't have flask on your computer, please install it with $pip install Flask. You can fork this repository and clone it to your desktop. You can run the code with $python3 server.py. Once you run it, you can type in http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your browser to see the webpage rendered locally.\n\nYou'll see a short list of NHL teams, their scores, and buttons to increase their scores. Right now, clicking on a button doesn't increase the score immediately, but you need to refresh the page to see the change. The goal is to reflect this change immediately on the front-end. Once that's done, we would also like to sort the teams so that whenever there's a score change, the list would change so that the teams are listed in non-increasing order of scores from top to bottom (you don't need to sort them alphabetically when there is a tie). To do these, you would need to make changes in both server.py file and scoreboard.js file. When you're done, please send a pull request to this repository with your name and uni in the comment. Thanks and good luck!\n\nASSISTANT: pip install Flask\npython3 server.py\n=== End Chat History ===\n\n---\nExecuting command: pip install Flask (Attempt 1)\nDefaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable\nRequirement already satisfied: Flask in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (3.0.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: Werkzeug>=3.0.0 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Flask) (3.0.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: Jinja2>=3.1.2 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Flask) (3.1.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: itsdangerous>=2.1.2 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Flask) (2.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: click>=8.1.3 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Flask) (8.1.7)\nRequirement already satisfied: blinker>=1.6.2 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Flask) (1.8.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata>=3.6.0 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Flask) (7.0.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from importlib-metadata>=3.6.0->Flask) (3.20.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from Jinja2>=3.1.2->Flask) (3.0.2)\n\nüîç Starting repository exploration and verification...\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Final Verification failed: Dependencies might not be fully functional.\n$Analysis$: The Python server failed to start as port 5000 is already in use by another program.
